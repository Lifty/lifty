Future work on Lifty & Lifty-engine

- Arguments should work sort-of like SBT. You you don't supply any arguments it should request input with a default suggestion. 
- It should be possible to put templates online.
  - Create a format for configuration of templates (instead of instances of Template)
  - Add some sort of versioning so it knows if it should download the templates
  - Create a update-templates command to Lifty-engine
