Lifty (Framework)
===

The development of this project started as my Google summer of code project in 2010

In few words the project aims to make it a lot easier for people to develop SBT processors which generates source files. Lifty was developed by Mads Hartmann Jensen during Google Summer of Code 2010. David Pollak and Timothy Perret were both mentors and without them this project wouldn't have existed. Thanks guys.
