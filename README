h1. Simple Build Tool Template Engine

In few words the project aims to make it a lot easier for people to develop SBT processors which generates source files.

Simple Build Tool Template Engine was developed by Mads Hartmann Jensen during Google Summer of Code 2010. David Pollak and Timothy Perret were both mentors and without them this project wouldn't have existed. Thanks guys.
